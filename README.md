# AI Functionality Demo (GitHub Copilot Example)

> “AI is not intelligence — it's functionality.”  
> This tiny web demo helps you show in class that AI can **perform** a task (calculate tax) but does not **understand** purpose or context (e.g., student exemption).

## 🎯 Goal
- Let one volunteer play the **AI assistant**.
- Show the class how AI computes quickly but ignores context.
- Deliver the closing line together: **“AI helps. Humans decide.”**

## 🧪 What the demo does
1. Enter a **salary** and click **AI Calculate** → AI computes tax with a fixed rule (33%).
2. Click **Reveal Context** → The person is a **student (exempt)**.  
   - AI output stays the same (it ignores context).
3. Click **Human Judgment** → Applies the exemption (tax becomes 0) and explains why.

## 🧭 How to use in class
- Open `index.html` in a browser (no install needed).
- Invite one student up to be your “AI assistant”.
- You click buttons as you narrate (or let them click) and ask the class:
  - “Should the AI change its answer after we learn the person is a student?”
- Wrap with: **“AI helps. Humans decide.”**

## 🗣️ 30–60s Script (you can read this)
> “Let’s test how smart AI is. Suppose salary is \$100,000.  
> AI calculates tax at 33% — super fast.  
> But now we reveal context: the person is a student and legally exempt.  
> Does the AI change its answer? No — it performs the function, but doesn’t understand purpose.  
> Humans bring judgment and ethics.  
> **AI helps. Humans decide.**”

## 🧩 Extend the demo
- Change rate to fit your country.
- Add zero-rated / exempt toggles (GST / VAT).
- Show “code snippets” on screen to mimic Copilot suggestions.
